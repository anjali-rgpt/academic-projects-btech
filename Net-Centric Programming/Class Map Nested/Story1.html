    <h1> The Story of the Lost Tree</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, there lived a young boy with a fear of trees. His parents were worried about this phobia, for it did not seem very seemly or usual. The village doctors had already looked the boy over for symptoms of mental illeness, but no, the boy was as fit as a fiddle, save for this disposition. Therein, they pronounced it a mere quirk and let him be.</p>
    <p> To attempt to discourage him of this strange habit, his parents bought him a tree. It was small, not so fearful, and had the most fragrant lemony scent. It would bear fruit, eventually, but not now, lest the boy be terrified by the process. And the parents bade the boy to take care of the tree.</p>
