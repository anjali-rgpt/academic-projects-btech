    <h2>A Headful of Thoughts, A Handful of Stars</h2>
    <h4>An excerpt</h4>
    <p>Let me be, strange wanderer, ask me not</p>
    <p>   Questions that riddle my already burdened thoughts.</p>
     <p>  Keep away, show no pity, restrain the benevolent hand</p>
     <p>   From grasping these shoulders and making me stand</p> 
     <p>  On my feet, by myself, alone- and yet lonelyâ€¦</p>
     <p> Two dimensions are these, though you think them one-toned. But free</p>  
        
      <p>  only are those that can thrive amongst crowds,</p>
